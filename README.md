# python Semantic Tableau Solver
This script can

1. Check wether a proposition is well formed or not
2. Solve for the validity of a well formed proposition, e.g. `(p∨(¬p))`
3. Show wether a premise entails a conclusion. e.g. `(p∨q), (¬p) ⊨ q`

Because a normal keyboard cant type out propostional logic symbols
* `&` for and, `∧`
* `|` for or, `∨`
* `->` for implies, `→`
* `<=>` for iff, `↔`
* `~` for not, `¬`
* `|=` for entailment, `⊨`
